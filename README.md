# 2023-SQAI-Demo: Quantum Deep Learning
## Introduction
This is an introductory technical demonstration on how to develop and train a quantum neural network with various quantum circuit configurations. The demonstration is built on top of Qiskit and Qiskit machine learning framework from IBM Quantum. The code was originally developed for the IBM Qiskit tutorial on the latest quantum machine learning framework. The original tutorial can be found [here](https://qiskit.org/ecosystem/machine-learning/tutorials/index.html)
